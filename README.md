# Sprint Challenge: Advanced CSS and Intro to JavaScript - Influential Artists

**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected _before_ starting this Sprint Challenge.**

This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past week and apply them in a concrete project. This Sprint explored advanced CSS and introductory JavaScript concepts. During this Sprint, you studied responsive web design, variable declaration, conditionals, loops, functions, arrays, and objects. In your challenge this week, you will demonstrate proficiency by creating a website of influential artists with data from an object.

This is an individual assessment. All work must be your own. Your challenge score is a measure of your ability to work independently using the material covered through this sprint. You need to demonstrate proficiency in the concepts and objectives introduced and practiced in preceding days.

You are not allowed to collaborate during the Sprint Challenge. Your work reflects your proficiency in Responsive Design, and JavaScript Basics.

## Introduction

In this challenge, you will use a data set of artists to build an "influential artists" webpage. This data comes from a set of "50 influential artists" on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ikarus777/best-artworks-of-all-time). We have reduced the data to just 20 artists to make it slightly easier to work with.

### Commits

Commit your code regularly and meaningfully.

## Interview Questions

### (please edit this file and write your answer below each question.)

Please answer the following questions below, you may edit the readme file to include your answers below the question.

1. ✅ How would you describe acessibility on the web to someone new to programming?
   Answer: Accessibility is the process of making a web page usable by all users, regardless of disabilities or other factors.
2. ✅ Talk about 3 different things you can do to ensure your website is accessible.
   Answer: 1. Within the HTML itself, use semantic tags to help keep content organized for screen readers. 2. Within the CSS, ensure contrast ratios are not so high that they hurt users' eyes but also not so low that folks with partial blindness cannot see the text. 3. Also in your styling, try to use appropriate color combinations that still allow color blind users to differentiate content.
3. ✅ How would you explain the concept of a variable to someone new to programming?
   Answer: A variable can be thought of like a labeled box. The contents inside of the box can be added, swapped out, or removed but the box is the same. We can access the contents of the box simply by using the box's label.
4. ✅ What is the purpose of using functions in code?
   Answer: Functions allow a particular piece of code to be reused. It's a concept known as DRY programming which stands for "Don't Repeat Yourself". The more reusable your code, the fewer mistakes you make, the less code you write, and the more readable your program.
5. ✅ How do you access a key inside of an object inside of an array?
   Answer: A key is similar to a variable but inside of an object. So you can access it in a similar way - by using the box's label. The difference is that you have to provide context by using dot or bracket notation which essentially provides a bread crumb trail to the key itself.

You are expected to be able to answer questions in these areas. Your responses contribute to your Sprint Challenge grade.

## Instructions

### Task 1: Project Set-Up

Follow these steps to set up your project:

1. ✅ Fork the repo
2. ✅ Go into canvas and connect your repo to codegrade
3. ✅ Clone your forked version of the repo
4. ✅ DO NOT CREATE A BRANCH. You will be pushing your changes to the main/master today
   NOTE: tests will run in the JavaScript portion of this challenge only.
5. ✅ cd into your repo
6. ✅ Open the terminal in your vs code and type `npm install`
7. ✅ Next type `npm run test` in your terminal
8. ✅ Complete your work making regular commits to main/ master your codegrade score will update each time you make a push.

### Testing & Debugging

✅ Open a second terminal inside of your project by clicking on the split terminal icon

✅ Inside of your second terminal type `npm start`
![alt text](assets/npm_start.png 'type npm start')

✅ You will be running your tests in one terminal and debugging in the other. As you work on your code you should make use of `console.log` to check your progress and debug.

### Task 2a: Minimum Viable Product - Responsive Design

_Before you jump in, take 10 minutes to review the code that has already been provided for you. Take time to see how the home page was built. During this time, [Review the provided design files](design/). You have been provided all content necessary in the [index.html file](index.html) and basic styling in the [index.css file](css/index.css)._

-   [x] Ensure your website is responsive at 500px such that your styles match the [mobile design file](design/Mobile.png).

### Task 2b: Minimum Viable Product - JavaScript

Navigate to `index.js` and complete the MVP challenges. Note that you need to scroll past data (or collapse data in VScode) to find the challenges below.
